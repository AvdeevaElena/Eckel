/*Exercise 24: Solve a single-producer, single-consumer problem using wait( ) and notifyAll( ). The producer must not
 * overflow the receiverâ€™s buffer, which can happen if the producer is faster than the consumer. If the consumer is
 * faster than the producer, then it must not read the same data more than once. Do not assume anything about the
 * relative speeds of the producer or consumer*/
